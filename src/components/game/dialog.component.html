      <h3 class="fw-bold">The Game of Life</h3>
      <p>The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. Itâ€™s a
        zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.</p>
      
      <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">How It Works</h3>
      <p>
        The Game of Life takes place on a grid of square cells. Each cell can be either alive or dead. The state of the grid
        evolves in steps, known as generations, according to the following rules:

        <div class="mt-5">
          <ul>
            Birth: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
          </ul>
          <ul>
            Survival: A live cell with two or three live neighbors stays alive.
          </ul>
          <ul>
            Death:
            A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
            A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
          </ul>
        </div>

      <p class="mt-5">
        The game starts with an initial configuration of live cells. From there, the grid evolves over time, creating complex
        and often beautiful patterns.
        Over time, certain patterns may emerge, including stable formations, oscillators, and spaceships.
      </p>

      <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5">History</h3>
      <p>
        John Horton Conway created the Game of Life in 1970 as a simplified model of population dynamics. It became widely
        popular after being described in Martin Gardner's "Mathematical Games" column in Scientific American. Despite its
        simplicity, the Game of Life demonstrates how complex patterns can emerge from simple rules. It has inspired research
        in various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and biology.
